                    <strong>Subhash Chandra Bose</strong> also known as netaji, was a prominent Indian nationalist 
                        leader who played a crucial role in the struggle for India's independence from British rule. 
                        He was born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, in present-day Odisha, India. Bose's determination, 
                        leadership, and vision made him one of the most iconic figures in the Indian freedom movement.
                        Bose's early education was in Calcutta (now Kolkata), where he attended prestigious institutions 
                        like the Presidency College. He later traveled to the United Kingdom to appear for the Indian 
                        Civil Services (ICS) examination, which he passed with flying colors. However, he was disillusioned 
                        with the British rule and chose to join the Indian National Congress, which was at the forefront of 
                        the freedom struggle. <br>
                        During the 1920s and 1930s, Subhash Chandra Bose emerged as a powerful and charismatic leader 
                        within the Congress party. He advocated for complete independence (Purna Swaraj) and believed in 
                        adopting more radical means to achieve this goal. Dissatisfied with the Congress' moderate approach, 
                        Bose later became the president of the party in 1938. <br>
                        However, his disagreement with Mahatma Gandhi and other Congress leaders regarding the party's 
                        stance on non-violence and cooperation with the British government led him to resign from the 
                        presidency. He formed his own political party called the All India Forward Bloc, which had a more 
                        radical approach and sought complete independence through any means necessary. <br>
                        Bose was briefly arrested by the British authorities but escaped and fled to Germany during 
                        World War II. In Germany, he sought support for India's independence struggle from Nazi leaders 
                        and even established the Free India Center, primarily composed of Indian prisoners of war captured by 
                        the Axis powers. Subhash Chandra Bose also sought assistance from Japan, forming the Indian National Army (INA) 
                        with the help of Japanese authorities. The INA aimed to liberate India from British rule through military means.
                        In 1943, Bose assumed the title of "Netaji," meaning "Respected Leader," and established a provisional 
                        government of Free India in Singapore, which was later shifted to Rangoon (now Yangon) after the Japanese 
                        occupied Burma (now Myanmar). Bose's INA conducted military campaigns against the British Indian forces 
                        in the northeastern part of India. <br>
                        Tragically, on August 18, 1945, Subhash Chandra Bose's plane crashed in Taiwan (then Formosa), 
                        resulting in his untimely death. However, speculation and controversy have surrounded his death, 
                        with some believing that he might have survived the crash and lived incognito afterward. <br>
                        Subhash Chandra Bose's legacy remains deeply ingrained in Indian history and the freedom struggle.
                         He is remembered for his fervent nationalism, unyielding spirit, and commitment to 
                         achieving India's independence. His birthday, January 23, is celebrated as "Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Jayanti" 
                         in India to honor his contributions to the nation's struggle for freedom. His life continues to inspire generations of Indians 
                         to work for the betterment of the country and uphold the values of courage and determination.
